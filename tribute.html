    <h2 id="subtxt">Birth of the legend</h2>
    <h2 id="Birth">Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931 to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque; his mother Ashiamma was a housewife.His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family.His ancestors had been wealthy traders and landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land. Their business had involved trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. As a result, the family acquired the title of "Mara Kalam Iyakkivar" (wooden boat steerers), which over the years became shortened to "Marakier." With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the family fortune and properties were lost over time, apart from the ancestral home.By his early childhood, Kalam's family had become poor; at an early age, he sold newspapers to supplement his family's income.</h2>
    <h3 id="Career">Career as scientist</h3>
    <h3 id="cr">After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO.Kalam was also part of the INCOSPAR committee working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist.In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965.In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.

        In 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility.Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam made an effort to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects, both of which proved to be successful.</h3>
    <h3 id="ms">APJ Abdul Kalam: The Missile Man of India</h3>
    <h3 id="man">Dr. Kalam’s journey in the field of science and technology began at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). He played a pivotal role in India’s space and missile development programs, contributing significantly to the nation’s defense capabilities. Kalam’s notable achievements include his involvement in the development of India’s first indigenous Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) and the successful launch of the Rohini satellite.

        However, it was his pivotal role as the chief project coordinator for India’s Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998 that brought him widespread recognition and admiration. The tests established India as a nuclear power on the global stage, and Kalam’s leadership and technical expertise were instrumental in the success of the mission. His exceptional contributions earned him the title “Missile Man of India.”</h3>

However, his legacy lives on, inspiring generations to dream big, work hard, and contribute to the progress of society.</h3>
